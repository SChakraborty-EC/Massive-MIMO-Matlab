Chakraborty, S, Sinha, NB, Mitra, M. Likelihood ascent search-aided low complexity improved performance massive MIMO detection in perfect and imperfect channel state information. Int J Commun Syst. 2022; 35( 8):e5113. doi:10.1002/dac.5113 

How to use the code: Two separate simulations cases are provided. The perfect channel state information (perfect CSI) simulation files are given in perfect_CSI folder. The imperfect CSI codes are given in Imperfect_CSI folder.

Perfect CSI simulation:

In this case we have added both simulation files as well as the script suitable for data export in consoliadate form. The exported data can be directly imported in origin for plot.


Imperfect CSI simulation:

Just run the  Imperfect_CSI_MassiveMIMO_Uncoded_BER.m code for imperfect CSI simulation
